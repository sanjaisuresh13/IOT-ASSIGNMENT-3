 Project Overview

This system is designed to:
- **Watch Temperature: Sensor nodes, with sensors of type, DHT11, measure temperature and humidity.
- ** alert propagation Nodes are also used to spread alerts with the help of the wireless communication when abnormal temperature conditions are identified.
- **Real time Monitoring: A concentration gateway appliance combines the data of the nodes and sends it to a cloud server via MQTT to visualize it in real time.
- **Power Frugality: put differently, the system implements energy-saving techniques by way of duty cycling and message encoding optimization thus can be deployed in long-duration battery-powered mode.
